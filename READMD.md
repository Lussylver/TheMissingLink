### Install

This guide was written for Ubuntu. You can easily install Ubuntu on a virtual machine using one of the many guides available online. It should be possible to do these steps on any other OS. The guide does not specify anything (yet) about using a virtual environment, but we recommend that you do so.

### Getting the code

Copy the `ssh` address of this repository (provided in the top right corner of this page) in your clipboard. Open a terminal (using `Ctrl`+`Alt`+`T`) and paste the following line:

`sudo apt-get install git`

Then:

`git clone git@github.com:Lussylver/TheMissingLink.git`

You should now have a folder called `TheMissingLink`:

```terminal
ilyass@ubuntu:~/Repositories/LM2$ ls
TheMissingLink
```

### Test it

### Input: deck

```
TheMissingLink:
    speed: [mm/s]:
    Slicer: [Name of the slicer used: `Simplify`]
    minTimeStep: 0.025
```
